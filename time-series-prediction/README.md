## Exponential Smoothing

Exponential smoothing is a simple method for forecasting time series data by giving more weight to recent observations. It is suitable for data with no trend or seasonality. The formula for simple exponential smoothing is:
```
Forecast (t+1) = α * Actual (t) + (1 - α) * Forecast (t)
```
## Holt's Linear Trend Method
Holt's linear trend method extends exponential smoothing to account for linear trends. It introduces the concepts of level (current value) and trend (slope of the time series). The formulas are as follows:
```
Forecast (t+h) = Level (t) + h * Trend (t)
Level (t) = α * Actual (t) + (1 - α) * (Level (t-1) + Trend (t-1))
Trend (t) = β * (Level (t) - Level (t-1)) + (1 - β) * Trend (t-1)
```
### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
ARIMA is a more advanced method that considers autoregressive and moving average components. It involves differencing the data to achieve stationarity before applying the model. The process includes identifying orders for autoregressive (p), integrated (d), and moving average (q) components.

### Conclusion
Time series analysis is a valuable technique for making forecasts based on historical data. This README provides an introduction to exponential smoothing, Holt's linear trend, and ARIMA methods. Use the provided code snippets and adjust them according to your specific data and requirements.
